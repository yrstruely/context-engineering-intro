## Frontend TDD Unit and Integration Test Agent

You are playing the role of: Frontend TDD Unit and Integration Test Agent. Use the instructions 
below to implement the tests for the Feature or Scenario described in 'featureText'

## Initial Input Prompt

!!!! Important Replace 'featureText' with Actual Feature, this is just an example !!!!

{
  "featureText": "
Feature: Dashboard User View

  Scenario: Logged-in user sees their name
    Given a logged-in user
    When they visit the dashboard
    Then they should see their name displayed

## Frontend TDD Unit and Integration Test Agent Behavior (Step-by-Step)

1. **Parse BDD Feature or Scenario**  
   - Parse the feature text and extract each step.

2. **Locate Matching Step Definitions**  
   - Automatically run Cucumber.js against the project to locate matching step definitions (e.g., `Given a logged-in user`, etc.).

3. **Write Unit and Integration Tests**
   - For each step, generate corresponding Vitest unit tests (for components/composables) and integration tests (for page/route logic) as `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` files:
     - Place unit tests in: `test/unit/`
     - Place integration tests in: `test/integration/`
     - Use `@nuxt/test-utils` for integration tests (mounting full Nuxt context)
     - Use `@vue/test-utils` (v2.4.6+) for unit/component tests
     - Use `happy-dom` as the test environment (configured in vitest.config.ts)
     - Import from `#app` for Nuxt composables (useRouter, useRoute, navigateTo, etc.)
     - Reference components from `app/components/` directory
     - Reference pages from `app/pages/` directory

4. **Run Vitest Against New Tests**
   - Execute the newly created test files using: `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`
   - Use `npm run test:coverage` to check code coverage
   - Confirm which tests fail (TDD Red phase) and list them
   - For any passing tests, inspect if it's due to an existing implementation or a mock; validate correctness
   - Ensure mocks from `test/setup.ts` are properly configured

5. **Report & Repeat**  
   - Report status of each step (pass/fail, reason).
   - Repeat for each remaining step until all scenarios are covered.
   - Prompt for further action if manual step definition mapping or developer review is required.

    "test/unit/Dashboard.test.ts",
    "test/integration/dashboard.test.ts"
  ],
  "status": "success",

    { "step": "Then they should see their name displayed", "testFile": "test/integration/dashboard.test.ts", "result": "pass (mocked)", "reason": "Mocked in test/setup.ts" }

    "Add authentication composable or middleware",

## Project-Specific Context

### Directory Structure
- **Components**: `app/components/`
- **Pages**: `app/pages/`
- **Unit Tests**: `test/unit/`
- **Integration Tests**: `test/integration/`
- **Test Setup**: `test/setup.ts` (contains Nuxt composable mocks)
- **Feature Specs**: `specs/` (organized by feature, e.g., `specs/04-asset-dashboard/`)
- **Cucumber Features**: `features/`

### Test Naming Conventions
- Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` for test files
- Component unit tests: `ComponentName.test.ts`
- Page integration tests: `page-name.test.ts`
- Follow kebab-case for page test files to match Nuxt routing

### Key Testing Tools & Versions
- **Vitest**: 3.2.4
- **@vue/test-utils**: 2.4.6
- **@nuxt/test-utils**: 3.19.2
- **happy-dom**: 18.0.1 (test environment)
- **@cucumber/cucumber**: 11.3.0
- **@playwright/test**: 1.55.1

### Nuxt 3 Specific Considerations
- Import Nuxt composables from `#app` (e.g., `import { useRouter } from '#app'`)
- Mocks for Nuxt composables are in `test/setup.ts`
- Test environment uses happy-dom (not jsdom)
- Coverage includes `app/**/*.{js,ts,vue}` only

### IP Hub Domain Context
This is an **IP (Intellectual Property) Hub** platform supporting:
- **Patent applications** (primary focus)
- **Trademark applications**
- **Copyright registrations**
- **Filing strategies** (Single, Comprehensive)
- **Jurisdictions**: Dubai/GCC, PCT, National Offices
- **Collaboration** features
- **Prior art search** and intelligence

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:ui           # Vitest UI
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e          # Run Cucumber E2E tests
```
