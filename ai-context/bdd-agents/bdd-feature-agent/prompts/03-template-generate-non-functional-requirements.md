## Best Practices for NFR Generation

### 1. Be Specific and Measurable
❌ **Vague**: "The dashboard should load quickly"
✅ **Specific**: "Dashboard initial load < 2 seconds (95th percentile, 50 applications)"

### 2. Include Acceptance Criteria
Every requirement should have clear, testable acceptance criteria that define "done."

### 3. Provide Rationale
Explain WHY each requirement exists. This helps prioritization and prevents requirements from being dropped during development.

### 4. Consider the Domain
IP Hub specific considerations:
- Legal significance of data (tamper-proof, long retention)
- Deadline criticality (high reliability, timezone accuracy)
- Sensitive data (strong encryption, access controls)
- Multi-currency precision (financial accuracy)
- International standards (USPTO, EPO, WIPO compatibility)

### 5. Phase-Appropriate Requirements
- **Phase 1**: Core NFRs that enable basic functionality
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced NFRs for improved quality
- **Phase 3**: Advanced NFRs for optimization

### 6. Link to Features
Cross-reference specific scenarios in the feature file that drive each NFR.

### 7. Define Testing Approach
For each requirement, specify how it will be tested (automated, manual, continuous monitoring).

### 8. Use Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Must-have for release
- **High**: Important but not blocking
- **Medium**: Should-have for quality
- **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements

### 9. Update Regularly
NFRs evolve as features develop. Review and update quarterly or when major features are added.

### 10. Get Stakeholder Buy-In
NFRs should be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders (security, legal, UX, engineering).
