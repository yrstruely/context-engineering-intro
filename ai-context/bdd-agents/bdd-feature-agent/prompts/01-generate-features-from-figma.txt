Use the BDD Agent configuration file: @ai-context/bdd-agents/bdd-feature-agent/bdd-agent-context.md and then generate feature files using these specifications: 
@specs/04-asset-dashboard.png. This specification file contains both screenshots and written requirements for the features. It also breaks down the feature into incremental 
phases, make sure to state which features are for which phase. Save the created feature files in the: @specs/04-asset-dashboard/ folder (if it doesn't exist, create it).
Before you begin, take a look in the @specs/ folder for previous features so that you can maintain a consistent style.
