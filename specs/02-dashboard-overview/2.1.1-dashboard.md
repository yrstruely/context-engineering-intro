# 2.1.1 | Dashboard

The Dashboard provides the primary entry point and unified command centre for all IP management activities.

## Overview
The Dashboard provides the primary entry point and unified command centre for all IP management activities. This interface consolidates portfolio status, application progress, critical alerts and quick access to platform functions into a single view. The dashboard displays active applications, registered assets, pending actions and navigation pathways to registration tools, expert guides and collaboration features across Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and other IP types.


## Why It's Important
Without a unified dashboard, users waste time navigating between disconnected tools and lose track of application status across multiple IP types. Critical deadlines become invisible when scattered across separate systems, leading to missed actions and abandoned applications. The dashboard prevents these issues by consolidating all portfolio activity, alerts and navigation into one interface, enabling users to assess status and take action immediately upon login.
